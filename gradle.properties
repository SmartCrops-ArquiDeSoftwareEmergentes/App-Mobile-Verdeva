# Project-wide Gradle settings.
# IDE (e.g. Android Studio) users:
# Gradle settings configured through the IDE *will override*

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# If you run into kapt IllegalAccessError on JDK 17+, either configure Gradle to use JDK 11
# (recommended) by setting org.gradle.java.home to your JDK 11 path, or use the JVM
# workaround below which adds module exports/opens to allow kapt to access internal
# compiler packages. Prefer using JDK 11 if possible.

# Example to set JDK 11 (uncomment and adjust the path to your JDK 11 installation):
# org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.17

# JVM args (workaround for kapt on JDK 17+):
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 --add-opens=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.main=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.main=ALL-UNNAMED

# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. For more details, visit

# org.gradle.parallel=true
